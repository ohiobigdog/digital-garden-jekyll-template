# Sources MOC
This is where I keep tabs on some of the sources I have encountered.

What "sources" should you track? Check out the tags pane. Find "source" and twirl it down. The sources I have decided to include tracking over the years include: *books, movies, songs, research papers, plays, paintings, quotes, videos, speeches, poems, tweets, articles, and newsletters*. 

Not included here, but in my personal vault, I enjoy checking out the comprehensive [[Source Starmap 🔭]] and perusing my [[Bookshelf 📚]]. And to honor the old ones, I also keep a [[Commonplace Book]] based on tags.


## A data view This is a simple data view pulling anything from the **Sources** folder.





```dataview
table tags
from "Sources" and -#on/readme 
sort file.name asc
```
