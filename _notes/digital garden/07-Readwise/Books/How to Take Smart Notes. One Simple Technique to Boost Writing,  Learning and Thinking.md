- Full Title: How to Take Smart Notes. One Simple Technique to Boost Writing,  Learning and Thinking
- Category: #books
- Summary: Writing down your ideas helps you understand and remember what you learn. Using a slip-box to organize your notes can enhance your thinking and generate new ideas. By making note-taking a habit, you turn your insights into a valuable resource for future writing.

## Highlights
- A good structure allows you to do that, to move seamlessly from one task to another – without threatening the whole arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3jq6q3ybeyspk7r4q8gfcgq))

- Thankfully, we don’t have to choose between usability and usefulness. Quite the contrary. The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible and to follow a few basic principles. The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level. There is quite extensive empirical and logical research on this phenomenon (for an overview: cf. Sull and Eisenhardt, 2015). Taking smart notes is as simple as it gets. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3p9hx68yn5bjbk7230kv5b7))
- If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words. Thinking takes place as much on paper as in your own head. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3qv1dp54hfed53d36s0tk4b))
- If there is one thing the experts agree on, then it is this: You have to externalise your ideas, you have to write. Richard Feynman stresses it as much as Benjamin Franklin. If we write, it is more likely that we understand what we read and remember what we learn and that our thoughts make sense. And if we have to write anyway, why not use our writing to build up the resources for our future publications? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3qv3mv6f4m1ghtj0jv2jc4e))
- Make fleeting notes. Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind. Don’t worry too much about how you write it down or what you write it on. These are fleeting notes, mere reminders of what is in your head. They should not cause any distraction. Put them into one place, which you define as your inbox, and process them later.

- Make literature notes. Whenever you read something, make notes about the content. Write down what you don’t want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing. Keep it very short, be extremely selective, and use your own words. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3qvq6y8p0rwvjhre1rd7d4r))
- Make permanent notes. Now turn to your slip-box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. This can soon be done by looking into the slip-box – it only contains what interests you anyway. The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions.

- Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j3qvrm5e1cx42kt9k9py4ag4))
- Now add your new permanent notes to the slip-box by:
  a) Filing each one behind one or more related notes (with a program, you can put one note “behind” multiple notes; if you use pen and paper like Luhmann, you have to decide where it fits best and add manual links to the other notes). Look to which note the new one directly relates or, if it does not relate directly to any other note yet, just file it behind the last one.
  b) Adding links to related notes.
  c) Making sure you will be able to find this note later by either linking to it from your index or by making a link to it on a note that you use as an entry point to a discussion or topic and is itself linked to the index.
