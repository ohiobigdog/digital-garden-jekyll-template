- Summary: Evergreen notes are designed to grow and improve over time, focusing on developing insight rather than just taking notes. Key principles for creating valuable evergreen notes include being atomic, concept-oriented, and densely linked. Implementing an evergreen note practice involves strategies like writing about what you read and organizing notes for deep internalization.
