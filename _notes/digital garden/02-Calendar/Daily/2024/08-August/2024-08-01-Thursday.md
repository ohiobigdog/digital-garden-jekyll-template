Spent the day fixing screens at work. Morgan stopped in to work on her new garden, so I got to talk to her for a little while. Got a text from Jen this morning, she told me that Callie passed away. It's sad cause I really liked that little guinea pig. She was the coolest, most chill thing ever!! Had to bury her in the backyard this evening. Brianna finds out tomorrow if she made it on the volleyball team that she's been trying out for. Hope she does or she's gonna be super disappointed. Got a text from PNC, yesterday, saying there were fraudulent charges attempted on my credit card. They cancelled it and are sending me a new one. Boy, I haven't had good luck with those PNC cards. My debit card also got hacked a few years ago.
