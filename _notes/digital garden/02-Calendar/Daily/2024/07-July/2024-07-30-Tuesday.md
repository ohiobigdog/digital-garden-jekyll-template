The alarm went off this morning and I really didn't want to wake up, even though I fell asleep early last night. Work was boring again, but I think I have to get used to that for the next few weeks. I stopped at Meijer on the way home and picked up a few things. After I was home for a little bit, I ran up to Walmart cause I am curious to try some denture adhesive, so I got a paste and powder. Let's see how that goes.
