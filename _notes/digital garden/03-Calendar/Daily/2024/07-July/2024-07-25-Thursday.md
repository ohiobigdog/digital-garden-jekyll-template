#log/journal 

Busy day at work today. Spent the whole day scrubbing the kitchen floor. I think it looks pretty damn good. I guess I better get used to it though, since that's going to be my normal section now. I'll be taking care of the lunch periods, cleaning the cafeteria and kitchen, the music rooms and the front lobby. Sounds like a grand old time. Jen and the girls are happy that my new hours will be 11:30 to 8:00 though. That means I'll be home in the evening before the girls go to bed and Jen won't have to end the night on her own. That's the main reason I said I would take the shift, because I knew it would make them all happy. 

Swung into Meijer on the way home and picked up some food, that I really couldn't afford. I just was feeling so bad cause Jen kept mentioning how we were down to almost nothing in the freezer. I decided I had to buy some meat, even if that meant trying to juggle a bill or two. Got some stuff and we had a nice taco dinner, so at least everyone was happy for tonight. 

Still trying to figure out this Obsidian thing. It's so complicated, but I'll get it eventually. I guess the easy part is....just start making notes. It really only gets complicated when you try to start adding all the fancy stuff. I'll learn it eventually. I like this app, so I hope to be using it for quite a while. 

I think that's it for another day. Talk to you later!!
