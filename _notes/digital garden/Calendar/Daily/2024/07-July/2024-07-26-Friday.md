Didn't go to work today because I woke up not feeling well. I was having some stomach issues today, so I decided to just stay home and relax. I would have been in the bathroom multiple times during the day if I would have gone to work anyways. Laid around all day and took it easy. I dozed off a few times, but that's ok. At one point, I did end up waking up to see squiggly lines in my field of view. I know that means it's a sort of seizure. Luckily I didn't get too bad of a headache after it was all over. Took some CBD oil and it seemed to help a bit.
