Started the pork butt around 10PM last night and it was finally ready around 3 or 4 today. I wrapped it in foil and left it in the smoker at 150 degrees. We had dinner around 6. Pulled it out and shredded it up. Was still nice and hot and it shredded magnificently. Definitely gonna have to start putting those in the night before. Makes everything so much easier, since they cook for so long. 

Jen called Damien and asked him if he wanted to come over and join us for dinner. We had a ton of pork and she knew that he was probably lonely at his grandma's house all by himself. He took her up on the offer and we all had a nice meal together. 

Other than that, just a Sunday trying to mentally prepare myself for another week of work. Tried to distract myself by watching the summer olympics.
