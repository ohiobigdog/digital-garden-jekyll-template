Today was a long day. The time seemed to drag by so slowly. Every time I looked at the clock, it seemed like time had only moved a small amount. 

Anyways, I had a busy day at work today. Did a lot of floor scrubbing and furniture moving today. The new guy, Jimmy, and one of the summer helpers know each other from school, so it's very annoying because they spend more time talking than they do working. We're getting close to summer cleaning being over with though, so that's good. We're in the home stretch. Less than a month till we switch to our normal shifts. 

I got a chance to talk to Colleen today. She's finally back from her mini-vacation. Showed her my new dentures and she seemed really impressed. She said they did a really good job. I agree. She also told me that she's the one that recommended me for the day shift I'll be switching to. She thought I'd be great with the kids during lunch time and that the schedule would probably work better for me because of my kids. We shall see. 

Softball season is finally over. Last night was, technically, the last games for both girls. Raegan does have one last make-up game next Monday though. One of the moms took all the girls on Raegan's team out for ice cream after her game. I wasn't in the mood to go, since it was late, but I wasn't going to tell Raegan she couldn't get free ice cream.....so we went. Luckily, she was tired, so we weren't there very long.
